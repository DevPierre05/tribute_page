          <h3 id="tribute-info" >The Life of The Legend Mandela</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mandela was born on the 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. He was born to Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa (Father) and Noqaphi Nosekeni (Mother).Mandela grew up in the village of Qunu.</li>
            <li>Mandela was the first in his family to receive a formal education.  He attended a mission school which was located near the palace.
        Mandela attained his secondary education at the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort in 1937. 
        He then attended the University of Fort Hare to attain his graduation degree but due to his involvement in the Student Representative Council and his boycotting against the university policies, he was told to leave. </li>
            <li>Mandela first got married to Evelyn Mase (1944–1958) and later married to Winnie Mandela (1958–1996) and finally to Graça Machel (1998–2013).Mandela had four daughters and two sons </li>
            <li>Nelson Mandela’s commitment to politics and the ANC grew stronger after the 1948 election victory of the Afrikaner-dominated National Party, which introduced a formal system of racial classification and segregation—apartheid—that restricted nonwhites’ basic rights and barred them from government while maintaining white minority rule. Also in 1952, Mandela and Tambo opened South Africa’s first black law firm, which offered free or low-cost legal counsel to those affected by apartheid legislation.</li>
            <li>Upon his return to South Africa, Mandela was arrested for illegal exit from the country and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The imprisonment protracted to become life-imprisonment for Mandela as he was convicted for crimes that had occurred while he was spearheading the ANC struggle. After this, he was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town and later to the Victor Verster Prison near Paarl from where he was eventually released.</li>
            <li>His years at jail had not weakened the spirit of fighting in him, as Mandela declared his commitment to bring peace to the black majority and give them right to vote in elections.
        He returned to the leadership of ANCF and resumed office as the elected President of ANC, headquartered in Shell House. In 1994, South Africa held its first democratic elections. The result of the election was in favour of Mandela who went on to become the country’s first Black President.</li>
            <li>Mandela was the founding member of the ANC Youth League. It was during his service at the ANCYL that he transformed the organization from its root level, trashing out all the old methods and employing fresh methods of boycotting, striking, civil disobedience and non-cooperation. His main aim was to kill racism, allow full citizenship to people, redistribute land, bestow trade union rights, and provide free and compulsory education for all children</li>
            <li>Two years henceforth, Mandela, profoundly influenced by Gandhi, set on the path of non-violent resistance. He formulated the Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups. Starting with a group of merely 10,000 people, in no time the numbers expanded to reach 100,000.</li>
            <li>On 5 December 2013, Nelson Mandela, the first President of South Africa to be elected in a fully representative democratic election, as well as the country's first black head of state, died at the age of 95 after suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection.[1] He died at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, Johannesburg, South Africa, surrounded by his family</li>
